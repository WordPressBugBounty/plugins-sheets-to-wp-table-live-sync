== ✨ AI Powered FlexTable ==

Transform static tables into intelligent, conversational experiences that understand and respond to your users' needs. It  delivers two powerful capabilities to enhance data accessibility:

1. **Instant AI Summary** - One-click comprehensive overviews of your entire dataset
2. **Interactive AI Table Assistant** - Conversational Q&A for deep data exploration

**⚡ Instant AI Summary**

With just one click, your visitors receive a clear and concise AI-generated summary of your entire table. People naturally prefer quick, ready-made answers over complex data tables. This intelligent data summary feature helps them understand your information faster than ever.

**How it works**

There are two quick ways to showcase the AI table summary for your users.

* **Generate on Click**: Visitors will see a button to summarize the table. When they click, AI will create the summary live using your prompt. Suitable for tables with frequently changing data.

* **Instant Summary**: You can generate and save the summary in advance. Visitors will see it immediately. Suitable for tables with mostly static data.

**🤖 Interactive AI Table Assistant** 

Beyond automatic summaries, empower your visitors with conversational AI capabilities. Users can ask specific questions about your table data and receive instant AI-powered answers tailored to their needs.

**How Ask AI Works:**

Users can type questions like:

* **"What's the average value in this column?"**
* **"Show me entries from last month."**
* **"Which row has the highest sales?"**

The AI analyzes your table in real-time and delivers personalized data analysis instantly.

This intelligent table interaction transforms static data into an engaging, conversational data experience.

== 💼 FlexTable in Academic and Administrative Management ==

Use the **Search Only Display** feature to create a focused search interface for your tables. It provides a search field that helps users locate specific entries such as student details, employee information, or institutional data. You can enable **column-specific searches** and control which fields appear on the front end.

This feature is useful for building tools like **student report cards**, **class grading systems**, or **course schedules**. It also supports broader record-management workflows where clear and accessible data presentation is required.

Examples of how it can be used:

* Let users search records by ID, grade level, or class section.
* Allow filtering of teacher profiles by department or subject.
* Enable front-end lookups for class schedules by time or instructor.
* Provide a searchable staff directory with role or department filters.
* Display exam results filtered by student name or course.
